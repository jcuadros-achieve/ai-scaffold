# ai-scaffold

Installs and manages the AI workflow structure (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` and
`.context/`) in any project. One command to get a team working with AI
consistently.

---

## What it establishes

ai-scaffold gives a project a **disciplined AI workflow with human gates and
persistent memory**, driven from a single source of truth (`CLAUDE.md`, which
Claude Code reads natively and `.cursorrules` / Copilot point at). Claude Code
is the primary target: skills install as native Claude skills under
`.claude/skills/`, which GitHub Copilot also discovers natively.

It sets up two chains of skills:

- **Work chain** — `ticket-clarify → task-plan → task-implement → verify → pr-write → pr-review`, 
  with human approval gates between understanding,
  planning, and coding, TDD during implementation, and a `verify` gate that runs
  the real build/tests/lint/audit before a PR.
- **Context chain** — `adr-write → ai-log-write → context-update`, an
  append-only project memory of decisions and AI sessions, with a regenerated
  `INDEX.md`.

Each work-chain skill ends with a **hand-off** that proposes the next step —
the human approves with a yes/no instead of remembering what comes next. And
the chain writes project memory automatically: approving the plan fixes the
decision, so `task-implement` drafts any required ADR **before writing code**
(step 0), logs the session at its close, and `pr-write` verifies the ADR still
matches the implementation and refreshes the index.

On-demand engineering skills (`security-review`, `refactor`, `migration`,
`new-endpoint`, `test-gen`, `review`, `debug`) cover deeper or recurring tasks.

Shipped rules enforce technical consistency, protected zones, and "read the
memory before proposing": `code-style`, `security`, `no-touch`, `context`,
`test-strategy` (TDD + coverage), `dependency`, `ci-gates`, `performance`,
`observability`, `resilience`, `api-contract`, `docs`, `git-workflow`. The
keystone skill `ai-init` analyzes the real codebase and fills the generic
rules with project-specific facts.

→ Full conceptual breakdown — what it generates, the flow, and what each rule
guarantees — in [`docs/OVERVIEW.md`](docs/OVERVIEW.md).

## Usage

> **Preview / demo** — this runs straight from the private GitHub repo. You need
> read access to the repo and git/SSH configured for `github.com`.

```bash
# Fresh install in a project
npx github:jcuadros-achieve/ai-scaffold install

# Check what would change vs latest templates
npx github:jcuadros-achieve/ai-scaffold diff

# Pull latest templates (shows diff, asks per file)
npx github:jcuadros-achieve/ai-scaffold update

# Check installed version and file status
npx github:jcuadros-achieve/ai-scaffold status
```

> **Future (company distribution):** once published to Artifactory/jfrog under the
> `@achieve` scope, the same commands become `npx @achieve/ai-scaffold <command>`.

### Choosing what to install

The **core** (universal rules + the workflow/context chains) is always installed.
Project-shape-dependent templates are **optional modules** you select — so a CLI
or library doesn't get database or API rules it has no use for.

- **Interactive** (a TTY) — `install` shows a checklist of optional modules to
  toggle.
- **Non-interactive** (CI, `--yes`, piped) — **core only** by default.
- **Flags:** `--all` (all optional), `--modules=migration,observability`
  (specific), `--core` (core only), `--yes` (no prompts).

`update` keeps the modules you previously chose (and lets you add more);
`diff`/`status` only consider what you installed. The selection — and the
installed base version of every template (per-file version + hash, from the
catalog in `scaffold.manifest.json`) — is recorded in
`.claude/.scaffold-version`.

Modules are added on demand, not up front. A backlog of candidate modules for
future phases is mapped in [`docs/CANDIDATE-MODULES.md`](docs/CANDIDATE-MODULES.md).

---

## What install does

1. Installs core templates + the optional modules you selected, mapping them to
   their native locations (`.claude/skills/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.context/`)
2. Generates the tool pointers (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
   `.cursor/rules/ai-scaffold.mdc`) and the `.cursorrules` symlink → `CLAUDE.md`
3. Shows a colored diff for any files that already exist
4. Asks you to decide per file: apply incoming or keep current
5. Records the selected modules and offers an initial git commit

## Using the skills

Skills are native Claude skills; Copilot discovers the same files
(`.claude/skills/`) natively:

| Tool | How to invoke | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `/<name>` | `/ticket-clarify` |
| **Copilot (CLI, cloud, VS Code)** | discovered from `.claude/skills/`; ask by name | "run verify" |
| **Cursor** | Reference the skill by name; it follows `.cursor/rules/ai-scaffold.mdc` | "run task-plan" |

## After installing

Run `ai-init` first to analyze the codebase and populate `CLAUDE.md` with
real content — **until you do, the context files are generic placeholders** and
the tools have little project-specific guidance.

```
/ai-init            # Claude Code
```

This fills in the generic templates with project-specific content —
stack, conventions, patterns, domain glossary.

---

## Updating templates

When new skills or rules are added to this repo:

```bash
npx github:jcuadros-achieve/ai-scaffold update
```

The updater shows a colored diff for every changed file and lets you
decide per file whether to apply the incoming version or keep your current one.
Files you've customized are never silently overwritten.

    skills/                 → .claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md
    context/                → .context/
  test/                     ← node --test unit tests (installer + catalog)
  scripts/
    update-catalog.mjs      ← maintains the per-template catalog (dev-only)
  scaffold.manifest.json    ← optional modules + per-template catalog
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
```

---

## Adding a new skill or rule

1. Add the `.md` file under `templates/skills/` or `templates/rules/` — skills
   need `name`/`description` frontmatter
2. If it's optional, add its logical path to a module in `scaffold.manifest.json`
3. Run `node scripts/update-catalog.mjs` (registers/bumps the template in the
   catalog — the test suite fails if you skip this)
4. Bump the version in `src/installer.ts` (`SCAFFOLD_VERSION`) and run `npm test`
5. Commit and push — projects using `ai-scaffold update` will see the diff
